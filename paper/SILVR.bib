  abstract = {Deep learning approaches have become popular in recent years in the field of de novo molecular design. While a variety of different methods are available, it is still a challenge to assess and compare their performance. A particularly promising approach for automated drug design is to use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as SMILES generators and train them with the learning procedure called ``transfer learning''. This involves first training the initial model on a large generic data set of molecules to learn the general syntax of SMILES, followed by fine-tuning on a smaller set of molecules, coming from, e.g., a lead optimization program. To create a well-performing transfer learning application which can be automated, it is important to understand how the size of the second data set affects the training process. In addition, extensive postfiltering using similarity metrics of the molecules generated after transfer learning should be avoided, as it can introduce new biases toward the selection of drug candidates. Here, we present results from the application of a gated recurrent unit cell (GRU)-RNN to transfer learning on data sets of varying sizes and complexity. Analysis of the results has allowed us to provide some general guidelines for transfer learning. In particular, we show that data set sizes containing at least 190 molecules are needed for effective GRU-RNN-based molecular generation using transfer learning. The methods presented here should be applicable generally to the benchmarking of other deep learning methodologies for molecule generation.},

However, due to the stochasticity of the generative process in DDPM, it is challenging to generate images with the desired semantics. In this work, we propose Iterative Latent Variable Refinement (ILVR), a method to guide the generative process in DDPM to generate high-quality images based on a given reference image. Here, the refinement of the generative process in DDPM enables a single DDPM to sample images from various sets directed by the reference image. The proposed ILVR method generates high-quality images while controlling the generation. The controllability of our method allows adaptation of a single DDPM without any additional learning in various image generation tasks, such as generation from various downsampling factors, multi-domain image translation, paint-to-image, and editing with scribbles.},

STRIFE takes as input fragment hotspot maps (FHMs) extracted from a protein target and processes them to provide meaningful and interpretable structural information to its generative model, which in turn is able to rapidly generate elaborations with complementary pharmacophores to the protein. In a large-scale evaluation, STRIFE outperforms existing, structure-unaware, fragment elaboration methods in proposing highly ligand-efficient elaborations. In addition to automatically extracting pharmacophoric information from a protein target's FHM, STRIFE optionally allows the user to specify their own design hypotheses.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has achieved tremendous success in designing novel chemical compounds with desirable pharmaceutical properties. In this work, we focus on a new type of drug design problem \textendash{} generating a small "linker" to physically attach two independent molecules with their distinct functions. The main computational challenges include: 1) the generation of linkers is conditional on the two given molecules, in contrast to generating full molecules from scratch in previous works; 2) linkers heavily depend on the anchor atoms of the two molecules to be connected, which are not known beforehand; 3) 3D structures and orientations of the molecules need to be considered to avoid atom clashes, for which equivariance to E(3) group are necessary. To address these problems, we propose a conditional generative model, named 3DLinker, which is able to predict anchor atoms and jointly generate linker graphs and their 3D structures based on an E(3) equivariant graph variational autoencoder. So far as we know, there are no previous models that could achieve this task. We compare our model with multiple conditional generative models modified from other molecular design tasks and find that our model has a significantly higher rate in recovering molecular graphs, and more importantly, accurately predicting the 3D coordinates of all the atoms.}

  abstract = {Molecule generation, especially generating 3D molecular geometries from scratch (i.e., 3D \textbackslash textit\{de novo\} generation), has become a fundamental task in drug designs. Existing diffusion-based 3D molecule generation methods could suffer from unsatisfactory performances, especially when generating large molecules. At the same time, the generated molecules lack enough diversity. This paper proposes a novel diffusion model to address those two challenges. First, interatomic relations are not in molecules' 3D point cloud representations. Thus, it is difficult for existing generative models to capture the potential interatomic forces and abundant local constraints. To tackle this challenge, we propose to augment the potential interatomic forces and further involve dual equivariant encoders to encode interatomic forces of different strengths. Second, existing diffusion-based models essentially shift elements in geometry along the gradient of data density. Such a process lacks enough exploration in the intermediate steps of the Langevin dynamics. To address this issue, we introduce a distributional controlling variable in each diffusion/reverse step to enforce thorough explorations and further improve generation diversity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing methods for both unconditional and conditional generation tasks. We also conduct case studies to help understand the physicochemical properties of the generated molecules.}

An open challenge in this area is designing linkers between disconnected molecular fragments of interest to obtain chemically-relevant candidate drug molecules. In this work, we propose DiffLinker, an E(3)-equivariant 3D-conditional diffusion model for molecular linker design. Given a set of disconnected fragments, our model places missing atoms in between and designs a molecule incorporating all the initial fragments. Unlike previous approaches that are only able to connect pairs of molecular fragments, our method can link an arbitrary number of fragments. Additionally, the model automatically determines the number of atoms in the linker and its attachment points to the input fragments. We demonstrate that DiffLinker outperforms other methods on the standard datasets generating more diverse and synthetically-accessible molecules. Besides, we experimentally test our method in real-world applications, showing that it can successfully generate valid linkers conditioned on target protein pockets.}

Computational generative methods have begun to show promising results for the design problem. However, they have not yet used the power of three-dimensional (3D) structural information. We have developed a novel graph-based deep generative model that combines state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with structural knowledge. Our method (``DeLinker'') takes two fragments or partial structures and designs a molecule incorporating both. The generation process is protein-context-dependent, utilizing the relative distance and orientation between the partial structures. This 3D information is vital to successful compound design, and we demonstrate its impact on the generation process and the limitations of omitting such information. In a large-scale evaluation, DeLinker designed 60\% more molecules with high 3D similarity to the original molecule than a database baseline. When considering the more relevant problem of longer linkers with at least five atoms, the outperformance increased to 200\%. We demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of this approach on a diverse range of design problems: fragment linking, scaffold hopping, and proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) design. As far as we are aware, this is the first molecular generative model to incorporate 3D structural information directly in the design process.

  abstract = {The process of finding molecules that bind to a target protein is a challenging first step in drug discovery. Crystallographic fragment screening is a strategy based on elucidating binding modes of small polar compounds and then building potency by expanding or merging them. Recent advances in high-throughput crystallography enable screening of large fragment libraries, reading out dense ensembles of fragments spanning the binding site. However, fragments typically have low affinity thus the road to potency is often long and fraught with false starts. Here, we take advantage of high-throughput crystallography to reframe fragment-based hit discovery as a denoising problem \textendash{} identifying significant pharmacophore distributions from a fragment ensemble amid noise due to weak binders \textendash{} and employ an unsupervised machine learning method to tackle this problem. Our method screens potential molecules by evaluating whether they recapitulate those fragment-derived pharmacophore distributions. We retrospectively validated our approach on an open science campaign against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), showing that our method can distinguish active compounds from inactive ones using only structural data of fragment-protein complexes, without any activity data. Further, we prospectively found novel hits for Mpro and the Mac1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 3. More broadly, our results demonstrate how unsupervised machine learning helps interpret high throughput crystallography data to rapidly discover of potent chemical modulators of protein function.},

  abstract = {A shape-based Gaussian docking function is constructed which uses Gaussian functions to represent the shapes of individual atoms. A set of 20 trypsin ligand\textendash protein complexes are drawn from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), the ligands are separated from the proteins, and then are docked back into the active sites using numerical optimization of this function. It is found that by employing this docking function, quasi-Newton optimization is capable of moving ligands great distances [on average 7 \AA{} root mean square distance (RMSD)] to locate the correctly docked structure. It is also found that a ligand drawn from one PDB file can be docked into a trypsin structure drawn from any of the trypsin PDB files. This implies that this scoring function is not limited to more accurate x-ray structures, as is the case for many of the conventional docking methods, but could be extended to homology models. \textcopyright{} 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {With the ever-increasing instances of resistance to frontline TB drugs there is the need to develop novel strategies to fight the worldwide TB epidemic. Boosting the effect of the existing second-line antibiotic ethionamide by inhibiting the mycobacterial transcriptional repressor protein EthR is an attractive therapeutic strategy. Herein we report the use of a fragment based drug discovery approach for the structure-guided systematic merging of two fragment molecules, each binding twice to the hydrophobic cavity of EthR from M. tuberculosis. These together fill the entire binding pocket of EthR. We elaborated these fragment hits and developed small molecule inhibitors which have a 100-fold improvement of potency in vitro over the initial fragments.},

These assumptions might involve complex architectures, auxiliary losses, or side information such as object part labels or segmentation masks supplied during training. We describe a simple approach for this task based on a transformer that autoregressively models the text and image tokens as a single stream of data. With sufficient data and scale, our approach is competitive with previous domain-specific models when evaluated in a zero-shot fashion.},

  abstract = {Contrastive models like CLIP have been shown to learn robust representations of images that capture both semantics and style. To leverage these representations for image generation, we propose a two-stage model: a prior that generates a CLIP image embedding given a text caption, and a decoder that generates an image conditioned on the image embedding. We show that explicitly generating image representations improves image diversity with minimal loss in photorealism and caption similarity. Our decoders conditioned on image representations can also produce variations of an image that preserve both its semantics and style, while varying the non-essential details absent from the image representation. Moreover, the joint embedding space of CLIP enables language-guided image manipulations in a zero-shot fashion. We use diffusion models for the decoder and experiment with both autoregressive and diffusion models for the prior, finding that the latter are computationally more efficient and produce higher-quality samples.},

The pipeline draws inspiration from generative models used in image analysis and represents a first example of the de novo design of lead-like molecules guided by shape-based features. A variational autoencoder is used to perturb the 3D representation of a compound, followed by a system of convolutional and recurrent neural networks that generate a sequence of SMILES tokens. The generative design of novel scaffolds and functional groups can cover unexplored regions of chemical space that still possess lead-like properties.},

Here, we develop an approach that simultaneously achieves both flexibility and tractability. The essential idea, inspired by non-equilibrium statistical physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model. We additionally release an open source reference implementation of the algorithm.},

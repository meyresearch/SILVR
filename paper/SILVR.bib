  abstract = {Shape-based virtual screening is widely employed in ligand-based drug design to search chemical libraries for molecules with similar 3D shapes yet novel 2D chemical structures compared to known ligands. 3D deep generative models have the potential to automate this exploration of shape-conditioned 3D chemical space; however, no existing models can reliably generate valid drug-like molecules in conformations that adopt a specific shape such as a known binding pose. We introduce a new multimodal 3D generative model that enables shape-conditioned 3D molecular design by equivariantly encoding molecular shape and variationally encoding chemical identity. We ensure local geometric and chemical validity of generated molecules by using autoregressive fragment-based generation with heuristic bonding geometries, allowing the model to prioritize the scoring of rotatable bonds to best align the growing conformational structure to the target shape. We evaluate our 3D generative model in tasks relevant to drug design including shape-conditioned generation of chemically diverse molecular structures and shape-constrained molecular property optimization, demonstrating its utility over virtual screening of enumerated libraries.},

  abstract = {Deep learning approaches have become popular in recent years in the field of de novo molecular design. While a variety of different methods are available, it is still a challenge to assess and compare their performance. A particularly promising approach for automated drug design is to use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as SMILES generators and train them with the learning procedure called ``transfer learning''. This involves first training the initial model on a large generic data set of molecules to learn the general syntax of SMILES, followed by fine-tuning on a smaller set of molecules, coming from, e.g., a lead optimization program. To create a well-performing transfer learning application which can be automated, it is important to understand how the size of the second data set affects the training process. In addition, extensive postfiltering using similarity metrics of the molecules generated after transfer learning should be avoided, as it can introduce new biases toward the selection of drug candidates. Here, we present results from the application of a gated recurrent unit cell (GRU)-RNN to transfer learning on data sets of varying sizes and complexity. Analysis of the results has allowed us to provide some general guidelines for transfer learning. In particular, we show that data set sizes containing at least 190 molecules are needed for effective GRU-RNN-based molecular generation using transfer learning. The methods presented here should be applicable generally to the benchmarking of other deep learning methodologies for molecule generation.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) outperforms traditional approaches in many molecular design tasks. ML models usually predict molecular properties from a 2D chemical graph or a single 3D structure, but neither of these representations accounts for the ensemble of 3D conformers that are accessible to a molecule. Property prediction could be improved by using conformer ensembles as input, but there is no large-scale dataset that contains graphs annotated with accurate conformers and experimental data. Here we use advanced sampling and semi-empirical density functional theory (DFT) to generate 37 million molecular conformations for over 450,000 molecules. The Geometric Ensemble Of Molecules (GEOM) dataset contains conformers for 133,000 species from QM9, and 317,000 species with experimental data related to biophysics, physiology, and physical chemistry. Ensembles of 1,511 species with BACE-1 inhibition data are also labeled with high-quality DFT free energies in an implicit water solvent, and 534 ensembles are further optimized with DFT. GEOM will assist in the development of models that predict properties from conformer ensembles, and generative models that sample 3D conformations.},

Combining multiple in silico methodologies, computational FBDD possesses flexibilities on fragment library selection, protein model generation, and fragments/compounds docking mode prediction. These characteristics provide computational FBDD superiority in designing novel and potential compounds for a certain target. The purpose of this review is to discuss the latest advances, ranging from commonly used strategies to novel concepts and technologies in computational fragment-based drug design.

However, evaluation of drug-likeness in absolute terms does not reflect adequately the whole spectrum of compound quality. More worryingly, widely used rules may inadvertently foster undesirable molecular property inflation as they permit the encroachment of rule-compliant compounds towards their boundaries. We propose a measure of drug-likeness based on the concept of desirability called the quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED). The empirical rationale of QED reflects the underlying distribution of molecular properties. QED is intuitive, transparent, straightforward to implement in many practical settings and allows compounds to be ranked by their relative merit. We extended the utility of QED by applying it to the problem of molecular target druggability assessment by prioritizing a large set of published bioactive compounds. The measure may also capture the abstract notion of aesthetics in medicinal chemistry.},

While conventional molecular design involves using human expertise to propose, synthesize, and test new molecules, this process can be cost and time intensive, limiting the number of molecules that can be reasonably tested. Generative modeling provides an alternative approach to molecular discovery by reformulating molecular design as an inverse design problem. Here, we review the recent advances in the state-of-the-art of generative molecular design and discusses the considerations for integrating these models into real molecular discovery campaigns. We first review the model design choices required to develop and train a generative model including common 1D, 2D, and 3D representations of molecules and typical generative modeling neural network architectures. We then describe different problem statements for molecular discovery applications and explore the benchmarks used to evaluate models based on those problem statements. Finally, we discuss the important factors that play a role in integrating generative models into experimental workflows. Our aim is that this review will equip the reader with the information and context necessary to utilize generative modeling within their domain.

In this work, we propose Iterative Latent Variable Refinement (ILVR), a method to guide the generative process in DDPM to generate high-quality images based on a given reference image. Here, the refinement of the generative process in DDPM enables a single DDPM to sample images from various sets directed by the reference image. The proposed ILVR method generates high-quality images while controlling the generation. The controllability of our method allows adaptation of a single DDPM without any additional learning in various image generation tasks, such as generation from various downsampling factors, multi-domain image translation, paint-to-image, and editing with scribbles.},

We train a neural network model on 12 million reactions from the Reaxys database to impose a pairwise inequality constraint enforcing the premise of this definition: that on average, the products of published chemical reactions should be more synthetically complex than their corresponding reactants. The learned metric (SCScore) exhibits highly desirable nonlinear behavior, particularly in recognizing increases in synthetic complexity throughout a number of linear synthetic routes.}

Additionally, no antiviral drugs or vaccines were developed against the closely related coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV, despite previous zoonotic outbreaks. To identify starting points for such therapeutics, we performed a large-scale screen of electrophile and non-covalent fragments through a combined mass spectrometry and X-ray approach against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, one of two cysteine viral proteases essential for viral replication. Our crystallographic screen identified 71 hits that span the entire active site, as well as 3 hits at the dimer interface. These structures reveal routes to rapidly develop more potent inhibitors through merging of covalent and non-covalent fragment hits; one series of low-reactivity, tractable covalent fragments were progressed to discover improved binders. These combined hits offer unprecedented structural and reactivity information for on-going structure-based drug design against SARS-CoV-2 main protease.},

STRIFE takes as input fragment hotspot maps (FHMs) extracted from a protein target and processes them to provide meaningful and interpretable structural information to its generative model, which in turn is able to rapidly generate elaborations with complementary pharmacophores to the protein. In a large-scale evaluation, STRIFE outperforms existing, structure-unaware, fragment elaboration methods in proposing highly ligand-efficient elaborations. In addition to automatically extracting pharmacophoric information from a protein target's FHM, STRIFE optionally allows the user to specify their own design hypotheses.},

Fragment-based screening is also less prone to artefacts as the low-molecular-mass compounds tend to be more soluble and the methods of detection are simpler and more robust.Two-dimensional, isotope-edited nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was the first approach used in fragment-based drug design. It is well suited to this purpose as NMR chemical shifts are exquisitely sensitive to ligand binding, and problems with compound interference can be solved by spectral editing.During the past decade, the popularity of fragment-based screening has grown at a remarkable rate in both industry and academia. A range of different strategies have been developed, including alternative NMR-based approaches that obviate the need for isotope labelling, approaches based on X-ray-crystallography and fragment tethering, which are discussed here.The ability to obtain NMR or X-ray crystal structures on fragment leads has a dramatic influence on the success of fragment-based drug design.The successful applications of fragment-based drug design have provided ample support that the use of fragments could, in many cases, be the most direct route to the best achievable balance between potency and pharmacokinetics.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has achieved tremendous success in designing novel chemical compounds with desirable pharmaceutical properties. In this work, we focus on a new type of drug design problem -- generating a small "linker" to physically attach two independent molecules with their distinct functions. The main computational challenges include: 1) the generation of linkers is conditional on the two given molecules, in contrast to generating full molecules from scratch in previous works; 2) linkers heavily depend on the anchor atoms of the two molecules to be connected, which are not known beforehand; 3) 3D structures and orientations of the molecules need to be considered to avoid atom clashes, for which equivariance to E(3) group are necessary. To address these problems, we propose a conditional generative model, named 3DLinker, which is able to predict anchor atoms and jointly generate linker graphs and their 3D structures based on an E(3) equivariant graph variational autoencoder. So far as we know, there are no previous models that could achieve this task. We compare our model with multiple conditional generative models modified from other molecular design tasks and find that our model has a significantly higher rate in recovering molecular graphs, and more importantly, accurately predicting the 3D coordinates of all the atoms.},

  abstract = {Molecule generation, especially generating 3D molecular geometries from scratch (i.e., 3D \textbackslash textit\{de novo\} generation), has become a fundamental task in drug designs. Existing diffusion-based 3D molecule generation methods could suffer from unsatisfactory performances, especially when generating large molecules. At the same time, the generated molecules lack enough diversity. This paper proposes a novel diffusion model to address those two challenges. First, interatomic relations are not in molecules' 3D point cloud representations. Thus, it is difficult for existing generative models to capture the potential interatomic forces and abundant local constraints. To tackle this challenge, we propose to augment the potential interatomic forces and further involve dual equivariant encoders to encode interatomic forces of different strengths. Second, existing diffusion-based models essentially shift elements in geometry along the gradient of data density. Such a process lacks enough exploration in the intermediate steps of the Langevin dynamics. To address this issue, we introduce a distributional controlling variable in each diffusion/reverse step to enforce thorough explorations and further improve generation diversity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing methods for both unconditional and conditional generation tasks. We also conduct case studies to help understand the physicochemical properties of the generated molecules.}

Given a set of disconnected fragments, our model places missing atoms in between and designs a molecule incorporating all the initial fragments. Unlike previous approaches that are only able to connect pairs of molecular fragments, our method can link an arbitrary number of fragments. Additionally, the model automatically determines the number of atoms in the linker and its attachment points to the input fragments. We demonstrate that DiffLinker outperforms other methods on the standard datasets generating more diverse and synthetically-accessible molecules. Besides, we experimentally test our method in real-world applications, showing that it can successfully generate valid linkers conditioned on target protein pockets.},

Computational generative methods have begun to show promising results for the design problem. However, they have not yet used the power of three-dimensional (3D) structural information. We have developed a novel graph-based deep generative model that combines state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with structural knowledge. Our method (``DeLinker'') takes two fragments or partial structures and designs a molecule incorporating both. The generation process is protein-context-dependent, utilizing the relative distance and orientation between the partial structures. This 3D information is vital to successful compound design, and we demonstrate its impact on the generation process and the limitations of omitting such information. In a large-scale evaluation, DeLinker designed 60\% more molecules with high 3D similarity to the original molecule than a database baseline. When considering the more relevant problem of longer linkers with at least five atoms, the outperformance increased to 200\%. We demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of this approach on a diverse range of design problems: fragment linking, scaffold hopping, and proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) design. As far as we are aware, this is the first molecular generative model to incorporate 3D structural information directly in the design process.

We then present results documenting 2.5 years of prospective use of POSIT across a variety of structure-based industrial drug-discovery research projects. We find that POSIT is well-suited to guiding research decision making for structure-based design and, in particular, excels at enabling lead-optimization campaigns. We show that the POSIT framework can drive superior pose-prediction performance and generate results that naturally lend themselves to prospective decision making during lead optimization. We believe the results presented here are (1) the largest prospective validation of a pose prediction method reported to date (71 crystal structures); (2) provide an unprecedented look at the scope of impact of a computational tool; and (3) represent a first-of-its-kind analysis.

  abstract = {Fragment based drug design has emerged as an effective alternative to high throughput screening for the identification of lead compounds in drug discovery in the past fifteen years. Fragment based screening and optimization methods have achieved credible success in many drug discovery projects with one approved drug and many more compounds in clinical trials. The fragment based drug design starts with the identification of fragments or low molecular weight compounds that generally bind with weak affinity to the target of interest. The fragments that form high quality interactions are then optimized to lead compounds with high affinity and selectivity. The weak affinity of fragments for their target requires the use of biophysical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray crystallography or surface plasmon resonance to identify hits. These techniques are very sensitive and some of them provide detailed protein fragment interaction information that is important for fragment to lead optimization. Despite the huge advances in technology in the past years, experimental methods of fragment screening suffer several challenges such as low throughput, high cost of instruments and experiments, high protein and fragment concentration requirements. To address challenges posed by experimental screening approaches, computational methods were developed that play an important role in fragment library design, fragment screening and optimization of initial fragment hits. The computational approaches of fragment screening and optimization are most useful when they are used in combination with experimental approaches. The use of virtual fragment based screening in combination with experimental methods has fostered the application of fragment based drug design to important biological targets including protein-protein interactions and membrane proteins such as GPCRs. This review provides an overview of experimental and computational screening approaches used in fragment based drug discovery with an emphasis on recent successes achieved in discovering potent lead molecules using these approaches.},

In this work, we introduce DeepLigBuilder, a novel deep learning-based method for de novo drug design that generates 3D molecular structures in the binding sites of target proteins. We first developed Ligand Neural Network (L-Net), a novel graph generative model for the end-to-end design of chemically and conformationally valid 3D molecules with high drug-likeness. Then, we combined L-Net with Monte Carlo tree search to perform structure-based de novo drug design tasks. In the case study of inhibitor design for the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, DeepLigBuilder suggested a list of drug-like compounds with novel chemical structures, high predicted affinity, and similar binding features to those of known inhibitors. The current version of L-Net was trained on drug-like compounds from ChEMBL, which could be easily extended to other molecular datasets with desired properties based on users' demands and applied in functional molecule generation. Merging deep generative models with atomic-level interaction evaluation, DeepLigBuilder provides a state-of-the-art model for structure-based de novo drug design and lead optimization.},

  abstract = {Free-form inpainting is the task of adding new content to an image in the regions specified by an arbitrary binary mask. Most existing approaches train for a certain distribution of masks, which limits their generalization capabilities to unseen mask types. Furthermore, training with pixel-wise and perceptual losses often leads to simple textural extensions towards the missing areas instead of semantically meaningful generation. In this work, we propose RePaint: A Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) based inpainting approach that is applicable to even extreme masks. We employ a pretrained unconditional DDPM as the generative prior. To condition the generation process, we only alter the reverse diffusion iterations by sampling the unmasked regions using the given image information. Since this technique does not modify or condition the original DDPM network itself, the model produces high-quality and diverse output images for any inpainting form. We validate our method for both faces and general-purpose image inpainting using standard and extreme masks. RePaint outperforms state-of-the-art Autoregressive, and GAN approaches for at least five out of six mask distributions. Github Repository: git.io/RePaint},

  abstract = {Deep generative models have achieved remarkable success in various data domains, including images, time series, and natural languages. There remain, however, substantial challenges for combinatorial structures, including graphs. One of the key challenges lies in the difficulty of ensuring semantic validity in context. For example, in molecular graphs, the number of bonding-electron pairs must not exceed the valence of an atom; whereas in protein interaction networks, two proteins may be connected only when they belong to the same or correlated gene ontology terms. These constraints are not easy to be incorporated into a generative model. In this work, we propose a regularization framework for variational autoencoders as a step toward semantic validity. We focus on the matrix representation of graphs and formulate penalty terms that regularize the output distribution of the decoder to encourage the satisfaction of validity constraints. Experimental results confirm a much higher likelihood of sampling valid graphs in our approach, compared with others reported in the literature.},

Most docking programs for pose prediction are optimized for redocking to an existing cocrystallized protein structure, ignoring protein flexibility. In real-world drug design applications, however, protein flexibility is an essential feature of the ligand-binding process. Flexible protein\textendash ligand docking still remains a significant challenge to computational drug design. To target this challenge, we present a deep learning (DL) model for flexible protein\textendash ligand docking based on the prediction of an intermolecular Euclidean distance matrix (EDM), making the typical use of iterative search algorithms obsolete. The model was trained on a large-scale data set of protein\textendash ligand complexes and evaluated on independent test sets. Our model generates high quality poses for a diverse set of protein and ligand structures and outperforms comparable docking methods.},

  abstract = {The process of finding molecules that bind to a target protein is a challenging first step in drug discovery. Crystallographic fragment screening is a strategy based on elucidating binding modes of small polar compounds and then building potency by expanding or merging them. Recent advances in high-throughput crystallography enable screening of large fragment libraries, reading out dense ensembles of fragments spanning the binding site. However, fragments typically have low affinity thus the road to potency is often long and fraught with false starts. Here, we take advantage of high-throughput crystallography to reframe fragment-based hit discovery as a denoising problem \textendash{} identifying significant pharmacophore distributions from a fragment ensemble amid noise due to weak binders \textendash{} and employ an unsupervised machine learning method to tackle this problem. Our method screens potential molecules by evaluating whether they recapitulate those fragment-derived pharmacophore distributions. We retrospectively validated our approach on an open science campaign against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), showing that our method can distinguish active compounds from inactive ones using only structural data of fragment-protein complexes, without any activity data. Further, we prospectively found novel hits for Mpro and the Mac1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 3. More broadly, our results demonstrate how unsupervised machine learning helps interpret high throughput crystallography data to rapidly discover of potent chemical modulators of protein function.},

It is found that by employing this docking function, quasi-Newton optimization is capable of moving ligands great distances [on average 7 \AA{} root mean square distance (RMSD)] to locate the correctly docked structure. It is also found that a ligand drawn from one PDB file can be docked into a trypsin structure drawn from any of the trypsin PDB files.

The hallmark of these methods is the use of "bridging" potential energy functions representing \_alchemical\_ intermediate states that cannot exist as real chemical species. The data collected from these bridging alchemical thermodynamic states allows the efficient computation of transfer free energies (or differences in transfer free energies) with orders of magnitude less simulation time than simulating the transfer process directly. While these methods are highly flexible, care must be taken in avoiding common pitfalls to ensure that computed free energy differences can be robust and reproducible for the chosen force field, and that appropriate corrections are included to permit direct comparison with experimental data. In this paper, we review current best practices for several popular application domains of alchemical free energy calculations, including relative and absolute small molecule binding free energy calculations to biomolecular targets.},

We show that explicitly generating image representations improves image diversity with minimal loss in photorealism and caption similarity. Our decoders conditioned on image representations can also produce variations of an image that preserve both its semantics and style, while varying the non-essential details absent from the image representation. Moreover, the joint embedding space of CLIP enables language-guided image manipulations in a zero-shot fashion.

Traditional SBDD pipelines start with large-scale docking of compound libraries from public databases, thus limiting the exploration of chemical space to existent previously studied regions. Recent machine learning methods approached this problem using an atom-by-atom generation approach, which is computationally expensive. In this paper, we formulate SBDD as a 3D-conditional generation problem and present DiffSBDD, an E(3)-equivariant 3D-conditional diffusion model that generates novel ligands conditioned on protein pockets. Furthermore, we curate a new dataset of experimentally determined binding complex data from Binding MOAD to provide a realistic binding scenario that complements the synthetic CrossDocked dataset. Comprehensive in silico experiments demonstrate the efficiency of DiffSBDD in generating novel and diverse drug-like ligands that engage protein pockets with high binding energies as predicted by in silico docking.}

Existing machine learning approaches usually first predict distances between atoms and then generate a 3D structure satisfying the distances, where noise in predicted distances may induce extra errors during 3D coordinate generation. Inspired by the traditional force field methods for molecular dynamics simulation, in this paper, we propose a novel approach called ConfGF by directly estimating the gradient fields of the log density of atomic coordinates. The estimated gradient fields allow directly generating stable conformations via Langevin dynamics. However, the problem is very challenging as the gradient fields are roto-translation equivariant. We notice that estimating the gradient fields of atomic coordinates can be translated to estimating the gradient fields of interatomic distances, and hence develop a novel algorithm based on recent score-based generative models to effectively estimate these gradients. Experimental results across multiple tasks show that ConfGF outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin.},

We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model.

The resulting ML models return a retrosynthetic accessibility score (RAscore) of any molecule of interest, and computes at least 4500 times faster than retrosynthetic analysis performed by the underlying CASP tool. The RAscore should be useful for pre-screening millions of virtual molecules from enumerated databases or generative models for synthetic accessibility and produce higher quality databases for virtual screening of biological activity.},

Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the image denoising task. More importantly, in blind image inpainting task, the proposed method provides solutions to some complex problems that have not been tackled before. Specifically, we can automatically remove complex patterns like superimposed text from an image, rather than simple patterns like pixels missing at random. Moreover, the proposed method does not need the information regarding the region that requires inpainting to be given a priori. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the tasks of image denoising and blind inpainting. We also show that our new training scheme for DA is more effective and can improve the performance of unsupervised feature learning.},

In this model, the composition of the protein binding pocket is effectively characterized through a coarse-grain strategy and the 3D information of the pocket can be represented by the sorted eigenvalues of the Coulomb matrix (EGCM) of the coarse-grained atoms composing the binding pocket. In current work, we used our EGCM method and a previously reported binding pocket descriptor, DeeplyTough, to train cRNN models and evaluated their performance. It has been shown that the model trained with the constraint of protein environment information has a clear tendency on generating compounds with higher similarity to the original X-ray-bound ligand than the normal RNN model and also better docking scores.

Recently, significant progress has been achieved with machine learning approaches, especially with deep generative models. Inspired by the diffusion process in classical non-equilibrium thermodynamics where heated particles will diffuse from original states to a noise distribution, in this paper, we propose a novel generative model named GeoDiff for molecular conformation prediction. GeoDiff treats each atom as a particle and learns to directly reverse the diffusion process (i.e., transforming from a noise distribution to stable conformations) as a Markov chain. Modeling such a generation process is however very challenging as the likelihood of conformations should be roto-translational invariant. We theoretically show that Markov chains evolving with equivariant Markov kernels can induce an invariant distribution by design, and further propose building blocks for the Markov kernels to preserve the desirable equivariance property. The whole framework can be efficiently trained in an end-to-end fashion by optimizing a weighted variational lower bound to the (conditional) likelihood. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that GeoDiff is superior or comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches, especially on large molecules.},
